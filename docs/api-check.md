# API check: seven requests against PostgreSQL

Start from an empty database, then start the app in a second terminal:

```text
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
python main.py
```

Run each request from the hotel-booking folder. curl prints the body, then the status code.
On macOS and Linux the command is `curl`; on Windows it is `curl.exe`. A ✓ after a request
means the answer was exactly the expected one.

Checked on 2 November 2026 against PostgreSQL 16 with db/init.sql (the same tables as the
postgres:18 container in docker-compose.yml): all seven ✓, and the booking survived the restart.

## 1. Search 12–14 Nov: R7 and R8 are free ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" "http://localhost:5080/rooms/availability?checkIn=2026-11-12&checkOut=2026-11-14"
```

Expected:

```text
{"checkIn":"2026-11-12","checkOut":"2026-11-14","rooms":[{"number":"R7","type":"Standard"},{"number":"R8","type":"Deluxe"}],"next":null}
200
```

## 2. Maya books R7 for 12–14 Nov ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "@docs/requests/maya-r7.json" http://localhost:5080/reservations
```

Expected:

```text
{"id":"R101","status":"Confirmed","notificationFailed":false}
201
```

## 3. Omar asks for R7 for 13–15 Nov: the night of the 13th is Maya’s ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "@docs/requests/omar-r7.json" http://localhost:5080/reservations
```

Expected:

```text
{"title":"Unavailable","status":409,"detail":"The room is booked for at least one night of this stay."}
409
```

## 4. Omar asks for R8 for 15–15 Nov: no night at all ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "@docs/requests/omar-r8.json" http://localhost:5080/reservations
```

Expected:

```text
{"title":"InvalidDates","status":400,"detail":"checkOut must be after checkIn."}
400
```

## 5. Search 12–14 Nov again: only R8 is free ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" "http://localhost:5080/rooms/availability?checkIn=2026-11-12&checkOut=2026-11-14"
```

Expected:

```text
{"checkIn":"2026-11-12","checkOut":"2026-11-14","rooms":[{"number":"R8","type":"Deluxe"}],"next":null}
200
```

## 6. Cancel R101 ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -X DELETE http://localhost:5080/reservations/R101
```

Expected:

```text
204
```

## 7. Cancel R101 a second time ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -X DELETE http://localhost:5080/reservations/R101
```

Expected:

```text
{"title":"NotFound","status":404,"detail":"There is no confirmed reservation R101."}
404
```

## Restart check: the booking survives

## 8. Maya books R7 for 12–14 Nov again ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "@docs/requests/maya-r7.json" http://localhost:5080/reservations
```

Expected:

```text
{"id":"R102","status":"Confirmed","notificationFailed":false}
201
```

## 9. Stop the app (Ctrl+C in its terminal) and start it again

## 10. After the restart, search 12–14 Nov: R7 is still booked ✓

```text
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}\n" "http://localhost:5080/rooms/availability?checkIn=2026-11-12&checkOut=2026-11-14"
```

Expected:

```text
{"checkIn":"2026-11-12","checkOut":"2026-11-14","rooms":[{"number":"R8","type":"Deluxe"}],"next":null}
200
```

R7 is still booked after the restart: the reservation lives in PostgreSQL, not in the app's memory.

The reservations table after the restart check:

```text
  id  | guest_name | room |  check_in  | check_out  |  status
------+------------+------+------------+------------+-----------
 R101 | Maya       | R7   | 2026-11-12 | 2026-11-14 | Cancelled
 R102 | Maya       | R7   | 2026-11-12 | 2026-11-14 | Confirmed
```

R101 was not deleted: cancelling changes its status, so the history stays (R4).
